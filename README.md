Fuselage to mast shims for Takuma foils (it should also work on older Naish and Gong foils).  This shim adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage, which changes the angle of the board relative to the waterline when foiling.  The main use of these shims is to make sure the board rides roughly parallel to the water surface when foiling. 

I think the stock Takuma setup is designed for boards with tail rocker or an angled deck.  For boards with a flat tail rocker and parallel deck, the board tends to ride nose down, which makes the board more likely to stop or stick when the nose touches the water.

I originally used printed shims, but switched to a machined aluminum version for extra rigidity.  I have extras available  for sale.

List of Shims and Adapters
This is a list of various shims and adapters I've designed for foiling, most are available on Thingiverse, but a few are for sale.

Baseplate to Mast Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle of the board to the mast.  This does the same thing as a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the baseplate. Axis 19mm version

Baseplate to Mast Flat Shim - Fills the gap between the baseplate and the sides of the mast extrusion to make the system slighty more rigid. Axis 19mm version

Surf Elementals Mast Adapter - Adapter to use the more rigid 19mm Axis aluminum masts with Takuma foils. Axis 19mm Mast to Takuma Fuselage version

Mast to Fuselage Angled Shim - Adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage.  It's similar in function to a baseplate shim, but it goes inside the fuselage.  Takuma version - aluminum  Takuma version - printable

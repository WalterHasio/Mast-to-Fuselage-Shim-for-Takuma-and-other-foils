# Mast-to-Fuselage-Shim-for-Takuma-and-other-foils
Fuselage to mast shims for Takuma foils (it should also work on older Naish and Gong foils).  This shim adjusts the angle between the mast and the fuselage, which changes the angle of the board relative to the waterline when foiling.  The main use of these shims is to make sure the board rides roughly parallel to the water surface when foiling.
